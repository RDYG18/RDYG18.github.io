¡Hi! I’m Roberto Damian Yáñez González  

I'm a Sustainable Development Engineer pivoting into Data Science. I’m passionate about using machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization to turn complex datasets into actionable insights. My projects include price prediction, cancellation analysis, user segmentation, A/B testing, predictive maintenance, and classification models. I’m excited to keep learning, building, and collaborating with others who are using data to drive meaningful change.

### A/B Testing for Landing Page Performance Optimization

- Conducted an A/B testing experiment to evaluate the impact of a redesigned landing page on user engagement and conversion rates  
- Randomly split 100 users into two groups: control (old landing page) and treatment (new landing page), collecting behavior metrics from both  
- Performed statistical analysis (at 5% significance level) to answer key questions defined by the E-news design team
- **Tools**: Python, pandas, scipy.stats, A/B Testing, hypothesis testing

### Predictive Maintenance for Wind Turbines

- Developed classification models to predict generator failures in wind turbines using environmental and sensor-based component data  
- Utilized a dataset with 40 predictors, 20,000 training observations, and 5,000 test observations shared in a ciphered format due to confidentiality  
- Conducted model tuning and evaluation to find the best-performing classifier to enable preventive actions before failures occur  
- Focused on minimizing false negatives to reduce high replacement costs while maintaining balance with repair and inspection actions cost 
- **Tools**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, classification models, hyperparameter tuning, confusion matrix
