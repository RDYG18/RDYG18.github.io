👋🏻 ¡Hi! I’m Roberto Damian Yáñez González  

I'm a Sustainable Development Engineer transitioning into Data Science. I'm passionate about solving real world problems through data analysis, machine learning, and visual storytelling.  
I apply Data Science to real world challenges across sectors like hospitality, tech, energy, migration, and e-commerce. My projects include price prediction, cancellation analysis, user segmentation, A/B testing, predictive maintenance, and classification models. I leverage machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization to deliver impactful solutions.

### 📰 A/B Testing for Landing Page Performance Optimization

- Conducted an A/B testing experiment to evaluate the impact of a redesigned landing page on user engagement and conversion rates  
- Randomly split 100 users into two groups: control (old landing page) and treatment (new landing page), collecting behavior metrics from both  
- Performed statistical analysis (at 5% significance level) to answer key questions defined by the E-news design team
- **Tools**: Python, pandas, scipy.stats, A/B Testing, hypothesis testing

### ⚙️ Predictive Maintenance for Wind Turbines

- Developed classification models to predict generator failures in wind turbines using environmental and sensor-based component data  
- Utilized a dataset with 40 predictors, 20,000 training observations, and 5,000 test observations shared in a ciphered format due to confidentiality  
- Conducted model tuning and evaluation to find the best-performing classifier to enable preventive actions before failures occur  
- Focused on minimizing false negatives to reduce high replacement costs while maintaining balance with repair and inspection actions cost 
- **Tools**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, classification models, hyperparameter tuning, confusion matrix
